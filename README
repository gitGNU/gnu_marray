This package  provides a library which is an extension for the
GNU Scientific Library (GSL). The latest version can be found at
http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/marray/

It allows to define and manipulate marrays, multidimensional arrays of
arbitrary order and arbitrary dimension different for each
index. Marrays generalize vectors and matrices, and are well suited to
manipulate data grids.

The library interface is very similar to that of gsl_matrix, and most
of the functions that exist for gsl_matrix are also implemented for
marrays and have the same syntax.

Its sister project is "tensor", which defines a new type similar to marray
but with the same dimension for each index (for matrices, that would be
square matrices), and with all the common operations used with tensors,
including tensorial product, index contraction and index swapping. It is
suited to work with tensor algebra. "tensor" can be found at
http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/tensor/

To install this software you first need the GNU Scientific Library
(GSL), that you can get from: http://sources.redhat.com/gsl/ . See the
detailed instructions in the file INSTALL in this same
directory. Briefly, all you need to do is:
  ./configure
  make
  make install
(for the last step you may need to be root).

If you took the files directly from the repository, you will need to
run ./autogen.sh first. That is:
  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure
  make
  make install

To use this library, compile your program with
  gcc -o myprog -lgslcblas -lgsl -lmarray myprog.c

That's it. Have fun!
